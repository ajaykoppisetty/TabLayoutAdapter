# TabLayoutAdapter
A helper library to easily create tabs with TabLayout

### Minimum API: 14

## Why was this created?

I was annoyed by the fact that the TabLayout doesn't change the alpha of icon tabs and restore state automatically, so I made this.


## Build

Add the following to your build.gradle:

```groovy
repositories{
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.rubensousa:TabLayoutAdapter:0.5'
}
```
